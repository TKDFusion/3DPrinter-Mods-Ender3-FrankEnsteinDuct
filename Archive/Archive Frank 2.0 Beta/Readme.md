#### Updates

14.08.2023: Finally another update
- Fixed the 5015 and hotendmount overlap (Thanks hawk16zz)
- Fixed the BL Touch Mount and hotendmount overlap (Thanks hawk16zz)
- Bl-Touch Mount should now be also compatible with the CR-Touch
- Added 5015 LED Ducts
- Added a new 4010 Adapter with an included ADXL Mount since the ones in the hotend mount are blocked with the adapter (Thanks Takus)


16.07.2023
- Fixed an overhang issue with the back of the Dragon, Stock and TR6 hotend mounts and the part cooling fan holders
- Added 5015 fan support (dual setup, single fan and LED Duct will be added later)
- Added Rapido UHF, this will be improved soon, maybe wait printing this but it works
- Extruder mounts are splitted in normal and highflow. Aside the Rapido every hotend uses the normal ones

09.07.2023
- Fixed an overhang issue with the back of the hotend mounts 

07.07.2023
- Added a mount for the Phaetus Dragongly BMO
- Added a mount for the Sherpa Mini with the K-Mount
- Modified the left 4010 holder to fit the Sherpa Mini K-Mount

05.07.2023: BL-Touch, stock MK8 hotend, LGX Lite and ADXL
- Added a mount to use a BL Touch (the holes on the plate can also be use used to use a permamntly mounted hidden ADXL)
- Added a mount for the stock MK8 hotend
- Added a mount for the LGX Lite
- Added a mount for an ADXL sensor - these mount to the front part of the Hotend mount, so you will have to reprint that part to use it

02.07.2023: Overlap fix + Dragon
- Fixed the little overlap between the extruder mounts and the hotendmounts on the rear screw point
- Added a mount for the Phaetus Dragon

26.06: I made an oopsie + BMS7 fin
- My mistake, I made a mistake with the basic layout of the first design so the stock hotend and 1:1 replacements won't fit (I used the 6 fin BMS as a reference and not the 7 fin BMS). This means that all the parts except the duct will not fit and will have to be reprinted if you have already printed them (I don't think anyone has done that, but just in case) (okay Andy - I'm sorry)
- Added a mount for the BMS fin

#### Draft BOM

A very Draft BOM, which gives you a rough estimation of parts you need:

##### Common
- 8x M3 heat insert (3x5x4mm - standard ones)
- 4x M3x35mm screw (main screws that hold everything together and to the plate)
- 2x M3x18mm (can be also 16mm or 20mm long, these are to mount the extruder mount to the assembly)
- 4x M3x12mm (to mount the 3010 fan, if you want to use a 4010, you need extra 4x M3x8mm to mount the adapter)
- 2x M3x6mm (can be also 8mm, maybe even 10mm long - these are to munt the backplate to the x axis metal plate)
- Plus the screws you need to mount the extruder to the extruder mount
- Plus the screws you need to mount the hotend to the hotend mount

##### 4010 Blower (Partcooling)

8x M2x8mm
